description = "Initializes your session with rules and best practices when writing Dart and Flutter code."

prompt = """
We're going to work on some Dart code, so please review the following for me:

1. Summarize the rules you have around working with Dart code.
2. Summarize the rules you have around working with Flutter code (on top of the Dart rules above)
3. Summarize the rules you have around working with Dartdoc API comments.
4. List the tools you have available for working with Dart code.

Please follow these rules closely for this session, and prefer using the tools over just running `dart` or `flutter` on the command line.
