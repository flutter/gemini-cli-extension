prompt = """
We're going to build a new Dart or Flutter package.

## Problem specification

First, I want you to prompt me for a description of what the purpose and details of the package will be, and ask where to put it.

If there are ambiguous elements, ask me questions to clarify. When the goal is clear, or I say to, then move on.

## Initial Configuration

If I didn't already give one, select a short descriptive name for the project.

Next, create a Dart or Flutter project (as appropriate for the purpose) in the desired location using the name. Unless I specify otherwise, the project should support all of the default platforms. Use the create_project tool to create it. For Flutter, create an empty project using the `empty` flag for the tool.

Remove all of the boilerplate in the new project, and use the `pub` tool to add the `dart_flutter_team_lints` package to the pubspec.yaml, and replace the contents of the `analysis_options.yaml` file with:

```yaml
include: package:dart_flutter_team_lints/analysis_options.yaml
```

Update the description of the package in the `pubspec.yaml` and set the version number to - [ ]- [ ]- [ ]

Update the README.md to include a short placeholder description of the project.

Update the CHANGELOG.md to have the initial version as - [ ]- [ ]- [ ]

Commit this empty version of the project to a new git feature branch.

## Design document

Develop a **DETAILED** Markdown-formatted design document that follows all of the guidance you have about Dart and/or Flutter design patterns, rules, best practices, and core principles. Save the implementation plan in DESIGN.md in the top directory of the new package.  Feel free to use your available tools to research any aspects of the design that need clarification.

The design doc should (at least) include sections for:

- An overview
- A detailed analysis of the goal or problem
- Alternatives considered
- A detailed design for the new package
- Any diagrams needed to explain the design (in Mermaid format)
- A summary of the design
- References to research URLs used to arrive at the design.

Have me review this design document and approve it before moving on.

## Implementation plan

Develop a **DETAILED** Markdown-formatted phased implementation plan of checkboxed tasks that need to be performed in order to finish developing the package. Save the implementation plan in IMPLEMENTATION.md in the top directory of the new package.

The implementation plan should include a section for the "Journal" which will be updated after each phase.

The plan should include instructions similar to: "After completing a task, if you added any TODOs to the code or didn't fully implement anything, make sure to add new tasks so that you can come back and complete them later." to prevent leaving tasks unfinished.

The implementation plan should specify after each phase that you should:

- [ ] Run the dart_fix and dart_format tools to clean up the code.
- [ ] Run the analyze_files tool one more time and fix any issues.
- [ ] Run any tests to make sure they all pass.
- [ ] Run dart_format one more time to make sure that the formatting is still correct if you made any changes during the analysis and testing steps.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes that have been made, and create a suitable commit message for any changes, following any guidelines you have about commit messages. Be sure to properly escape dollar signs and backticks, and present the change message to me for approval.
- [ ] Re-read the IMPLEMENTATION.md file to see what, if anything, has changed in the implementation plan, and if it has changed, take care of anything the changes imply.
- [ ] Update the IMPLEMENTATION.md file with the current state, including any learnings, surprises, or deviations in the Journal section.
- [ ] Wait for approval. Don't commit the changes or move on to the next phase of implementation until I approve the commit.

In the last phase of the plan, you should include a step to create a comprehensive README.md file for the package.

Have me review this implementation plan and approve it before starting implementation.
