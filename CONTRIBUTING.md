## Issue triage

We regularly triage issues by looking at newly filed issues and determining what we should do about each of them. Triage issues as follows:

- Open the [list of untriaged issues][untriaged_list].
- For each issue in the list, do one of:
  - If we don't plan to fix the issue, close it with an explanation.
  - If we plan to fix the issue, add the `triaged` label and assign a priority: [P0][P0], [P1][P1], [P2][P2], or [P3][P3]. If you don't know which priority to assign, apply `P2`. If an issue is `P0` or `P1`, add it to a milestone.

At the end of a triage session, the untriaged issue list should be as close to empty as possible.
